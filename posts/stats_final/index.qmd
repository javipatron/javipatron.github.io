## Introduction

Blue carbon is attracting massive attention from governments, investors, and companies needing carbon accounting practices. Mangrove forests can sequester almost ten times more than boreal, temperate, or tropical forests, thanks to the mangrove biological characteristics. That is one of the main reasons they received the nickname of *"The Superheroes of Climate Change."*

Carbon stocks are the total amount of organic carbon stored within a system and are comprised of carbon pools, which fall into different bins: living aboveground living (live plants, including epiphytes); dead aboveground biomass (e.g., fallen branches); living belowground biomass (e.g., roots); and belowground carbon (sediment organic matter).

With that in mind, it is critical to understand the main factors to calculate the total mangrove carbon stocks' in restoration practices. Additionally, to analyze and calculate an appropriate amount of tree samples and plot sizes to estimate the amount of carbon storage in the area.

[![The more you know: Mangroves (2020)](intro-mangrove.jpeg)](https://www.ripleyaquariums.com/canada/the-more-you-know-mangroves/)

#### Is there existing evidence for this question? If so, why is it inconclusive?

Blue carbon accounting is a new strategy with few practical examples and evidence worldwide. Some methodologies align with the Verra non-profit organization VCS (Verified Carbon Standard) that helps us describe and outline the correct procedures to quantify the net greenhouse gas emission reductions and removals resulting from project activities implemented to restore tidal wetlands. For this case, the provided data uses equations and formulas designed on the VCS0032 and VCS0033 methodologies, which are aligned with the VCS.

## Data

The data are real field measurements from mangrove tree´s over 4 different replantation sites (2010, 2016, 2017, 2020). This data was provided directly to me by Silvestrum Climate Associates ®. This data is confidential and there is limited access to the site.

```{r, echo = F, warning = F, message = F}
#Setting my filepaths
#rootdir <- ("/Users/javipatron/Documents/MEDS/Courses/eds222/homework/eds222-finalproject")
#data <- file.path(rootdir,"data")
#mangrove_df <- read_csv("data","clean_monitoring_data_javier.csv") |> clean_names()

mangrove_df<- read_csv("/Users/javipatron/Documents/MEDS/Courses/eds222/homework/eds222-finalproject/data/clean_monitoring_data_javier.csv") |> 
  clean_names()

#/Users/javipatron/Documents/MEDS/Courses/eds222/homework/eds222-finalproject/data/clean_monitoring_data_javier.csv
```

```{r, echo = F, warning = F, message = F}
#Cleaning and adding some changes to the data
mangrove_df$plantation_year <- as.character(mangrove_df$plantation_year)
mangrove_df$plot <- as.character(mangrove_df$plot)
mangrove_df$plot_size_m2 <- as.factor(mangrove_df$plot_size_m2)
```

#### Limitations, spatial and temporal features.

The dataset has a measurement record for each tree´s height and canopy. With those measurements, Silvestrum has calculated the total tree carbon in (kg) and the total tree carbon per hectare in (Mg/ha). In this analysis, we will assume that the correct protocols and equations were followed for this purpose, and this analysis is dependent from those results.

Regarding the dataset, the above and below ground carbon storage was assessed using a nested sub-sampling protocol along the 25m2, 77m2, and 154m2 transect following the [Kauffman and Donato](https://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/WPapers/WP86CIFOR.pdf "Reference #4") procedure. The equations for above and below ground biomass are defined by [Comley and McGuiness.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248899546_Above-_and_below-ground_biomass_and_allometry_of_four_common_northern_Australian_mangroves "Reference #5")

The mathematically calculations made my the owner of this dataset is a limitation, as we do not have actual carbon samples to analyze. Another limitation is the possible man errors from the field sampling and the natural growth and variability from the mangroves.

To get you familiarized, the table below shows the first 5 rows of the data which this post will be studying. It has a total of 10,826 rows and 11 columns.

```{r, echo =F, message = F, warning= F}

head(mangrove_df) %>% 
  kbl(align=rep('c', 5),
      caption = "Table 1. Full Mangrove Data Set (head)") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```

```{r, echo =F, message = F, warning= F}
# Create a table that is grouped by each plantation year, showing the total number of sample plots and the total number of trees per plantation effort.

mangrove_summary <- mangrove_df |> 
  group_by(plantation_year) |> 
  summarise("Plot Count" = length(unique(plot)),
          "Sample Count" = n(),
          "Total Carbon (mg/ha)" = sum(total_tree_mg_c_ha),
          "Total Carbon Variance (mg/ha)" = sd(total_tree_mg_c_ha))

mangrove_summary %>% 
  kbl(align=rep('c', 5),
      caption ="Table 2. Total mangrove Dataset summary",
      position = "left") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(2, bold = T, color = "gray10", background = "lightblue")
```

As we can see in the table above, the 2017 plantation year has an exciting number of samples, different sample plot sizes, and high variation of total carbon in Mg per hectare. We will focus on this year to answer our questions.

The table #3 contains only information from the 2017 plantation year. We will use this filter to analyse the different questions, and interpret our results.

```{r, warning = F, message = F }
mangrove_2017 <- mangrove_df |> 
  filter(plantation_year == 2017) |> 
  select(height_cm,plot, plot_size_m2, cd_chatting_m,total_tree_kg_c,total_tree_mg_c_ha)
mangrove_2017 <- mangrove_2017[!(mangrove_2017$total_tree_mg_c_ha== 1.224),]

#Statistical Table with the selected variables for question #1
mangrove_plots_2017 <- mangrove_2017 |> 
  group_by(plot_size_m2) |> 
  summarise(tot_samples = n(),
            tot_plot_count = length(unique(plot)),
            mean_tree_c_ha = mean(total_tree_mg_c_ha),
            sd_tree_c_ha = sd(total_tree_mg_c_ha)) |> 
  mutate(plot_size_m2 = c("25m2", "77m2", "154m2"))

mangrove_plots_2017 %>% 
  kbl(align=rep('c', 5),
      caption ="Table 3. Plot summary of the 2017 plantation year",
      position = "left") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)

#Statistical table of each unique plot to analyse variability in the question #2
plots_2017 <- mangrove_2017 |> 
  group_by(plot, plot_size_m2) |> 
  summarise(sample_count = n(),
            mean_tree_c = mean(total_tree_kg_c),
            mean_carbon_mg_ha = mean(total_tree_mg_c_ha),
            sd_tree_c = sd(total_tree_kg_c),
            sd_tree_c_ha = sd(total_tree_mg_c_ha))


```

Now let us take a closer look at the effect of sample plot size and the total tree carbon (Mg/ha).

```{r}
#Boxplot
boxplot_2017 <- mangrove_2017 |>
  ggplot(aes(x=plot_size_m2, y = total_tree_mg_c_ha,color = plot_size_m2)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Tree Carbon vs Plot Type",
       subititle = "Plantation Year - 2017",
       x = "Plot Size (m2)",
       y = "Total Tree Carbon (Mg/ha)") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") 

ggplotly(boxplot_2017)

```

## Question 1

The graph above shows a visual difference in carbon means between the 25m2 sample plot and the other two sample plots. So let us analyze the relationship between the 77m2 and the 154m2, with a hypothesis test and see if the means in the total carbon per tree (Mg/ha) are different.

**Analysis:** *Hypothesis Testing between 77m2 vs 154m2*

The Null Hypothesis - The Total Carbon per Tree (mg/ha) mean in the Sample Size of 77m2 is no different from the 154m2.

$$H_0: \mu_{77m2} - \mu_{154m2} = 0$$

Alternative Hypothesis- The Total Carbon per Tree (mg/ha) in the sample size of 77m2 is different from the one the 154m2.

$$H_0: \mu_{77m2} - \mu_{154m2} \neq 0$$

Calculate the Point Estimate and the Standard Error

$$SE = \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}$$

```{r}
#Calculate Point Estimate
point_est_2 = (mangrove_plots_2017$mean_tree_c_ha[2] - mangrove_plots_2017$mean_tree_c_ha[3])

#Define the Standard Error
n_77m = mangrove_plots_2017$tot_samples[2]
s_77m =  mangrove_plots_2017$sd_tree_c_ha[2]
n_154m = mangrove_plots_2017$tot_samples[3]
s_154m =  mangrove_plots_2017$sd_tree_c_ha[3]

print(paste("Point Estimate:", round(point_est_2,5)))


SE_2 = as.numeric(sqrt(s_77m^2/n_77m + s_154m^2/n_154m))
print(paste("Standard Error:", round(SE_2,5)))

```

Calculate the Z-Score $$z_{score}=\frac{\text { point estimate }-\text { null value }}{S E}$$

```{r}
z_score_2 <- (point_est_2 - 0) / SE_2
z_score_2
```

The Z-Score will tell us that the the observed difference between a sample plot of 77m2 and 154m2 is 9.3 standard deviations above our null hypothesis of "zero difference" of our dependent variable in Tree Carbon (Mg/ha).

Calculate the p-value and run a t - test

```{r}
option2_ttest <- t.test(mangrove_2017$total_tree_mg_c_ha[mangrove_2017$plot_size_m2 == 76.969], mangrove_2017$total_tree_mg_c_ha[mangrove_2017$plot_size_m2 == 153.938])
option2_ttest
```

### Results:

**With this results we can reject the null as the p-value is telling us there it exists a statistical significant difference between the means of carbon storage between the sample plot size of 77m2 to the sample size of 154m2.**

We are 95% confident that the true value of the difference in tree carbon across the two plot sizes lies between 0.0262 - 0.0403 mg per hectare.

This graph summarizes all the important take away.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}

crit_val_2 = qnorm(0.025, lower.tail = F)
ci_lower_2 = round(point_est_2 - crit_val_2*SE_2, 3)
ci_upper_2 = round(point_est_2 + crit_val_2*SE_2, 2)

                        guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(color = c("gray50", "gray10"))))

```

### Important take away from Question 1

As we can see in the graph, both means are close to each other, but they are statistically significantly different. **With this data analysis and results, we can help the actual client better understand their plot sampling sizes, concluding that smaller plot sizes are getting a larger carbon estimate.**

## **Question 2:**

Let analyze why the smaller plots are getting a larger estimate of total carbon per hectare.

For this purpose, we will create a new table and graph to easily visualize what the density per plot type (Number of trees per m2) looks like:

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
#Changing the column to numeric
mangrove_df$plot_size_m2_num <- as.numeric(mangrove_df$plot_size_m2)

density_df <- read_csv("/Users/javipatron/Documents/MEDS/Courses/eds222/homework/eds222-finalproject/data/clean_monitoring_data_javier.csv") |> 
  clean_names() |> 
  filter(plantation_year == 2017) |> 
  select(height_cm,plot, plot_size_m2, cd_chatting_m,total_tree_kg_c,total_tree_mg_c_ha) |> 
  group_by(plot, plot_size_m2) |> 
  summarise(sample_count = n(),
            mean_hight = mean(height_cm),
            mean_tree_c = mean(total_tree_kg_c),
            mean_carbon_mg_ha = mean(total_tree_mg_c_ha),
            sd_tree_c = sd(total_tree_kg_c),
            sd_tree_c_ha = sd(total_tree_mg_c_ha)) |> 
  mutate(density = sample_count/plot_size_m2)

head(density_df) %>% 
  kbl(align=rep('c', 5),
      caption ="Table 4. Density Table per Plot",
      position = "left") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)

density_graph <- ggplot(density_df, aes(x= as.factor(plot_size_m2), y= density, fill = as.factor(plot_size_m2))) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Density of trees per plot size",
       x= "Plot Size (m2)",
       y = "Density (Tree/m2)",
       col = "Plot Size (m2)") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Plot Type")

ggplotly(density_graph)

```

As we can see in this graph, the plot sizes significantly differ in density (Number of trees per m2). Plots of 25 m2 have a density of 3.2 trees per m2, and plots of 77 m2 have a density of 0.873 trees per m2. To avoid possible bias, this is a point to highlight for future projects.

Now, to visually show the effect of plot sizes on the total carbon per tree, let us take a deeper look at these two histograms.

This Histogram shows how much variance we have between our plots.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
ggplot(plots_2017, aes(x=sd_tree_c_ha)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = stat(density)), color = "gray20", fill = "darkolivegreen", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_density(col = "gray30", alpha = 0.15, fill = "green") +
  labs(title = "Total Carbon per Tree (mg/ha)",
       subtitle = "All Plots",
       x = "Tree Carbon Variance (mg/ha)",
       y = "Denisity Plots")

```

We have a skew right histogram with a long tail. Now let us analyze this same plot, but separating per plot type, to see who is responsible for those outliers.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
histogram_plot <- plots_2017 |> 
  filter(plot_size_m2 %in% c(25.133, 76.969, 153.938)) |> 
ggplot(aes(x=sd_tree_c_ha)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = stat(density), fill = plot_size_m2),color = "gray30", alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = plot_size_m2), col = "gray30", alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(title = "Total Carbon per Tree (mg/ha)",
       subtitle = "Per Plot",
       x = "Tree Cabron Variance (mg/ha)",
       y = "Density Plots")

ggplotly(histogram_plot)

```

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
#Total Tree Carbon (mg/ha)
# Just the 25m2
mangrove_2017 |> 
  filter(plot_size_m2 == 25.133) |> 
ggplot(aes(x=total_tree_mg_c_ha)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = stat(density)), fill = "red", color = "gray30", alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_density(col = "gray30", alpha = 0.3, fill = "gray10") +
  labs(title = "Total Carbon per Tree (mg/ha)",
       subtitle = "25m2")
```

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
#Total Tree Carbon (mg/ha)
# Just the 77m2
mangrove_2017 |> 
  filter(plot_size_m2 == 76.969) |> 
ggplot(aes(x=total_tree_mg_c_ha)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = stat(density)), fill = "lightgreen", color = "gray30") +
  geom_density(col = "gray30", alpha = 0.5, fill = "gray10") +
  labs(title = "Total Carbon per Tree (mg/ha)",
       subtitle = "77m2")
```

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
#Total Tree Carbon (mg/ha)
# Just the 154m2
mangrove_2017 |> 
  filter(plot_size_m2 == 153.938) |> 
ggplot(aes(x=total_tree_mg_c_ha)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = stat(density)), fill = "lightblue", color = "gray30") +
  geom_density(col = "gray30", alpha = 0.5, fill = "gray10") +
  labs(title = "Total Carbon per Tree (mg/ha)",
       subtitle = "154m2")

```

### Important take away from Question 2:

The 25m2 plots have the highest carbon per hectare, a higher density of trees per m2, and a higher variance in their calculations. Overall, the plot of 25m2 has a more considerable amount of carbon stock per hectare, however, with high variability, which is not very confident for the methodologies and the Verified Carbon Standard protocols.

An important take away to ask and further analyse with Silvestrum, is why the 25m2 samples are having the highest trees records and the highest tree density in comparison to the 77m2 and 154m2.

## Question 3:

As we can see a significant effect of sample plot size in the calculated Total Carbon per Tree, it would be helpful to put our shoes in the field, and estimate an appropriate sample size to determine the amount of carbon storage in this same area.

First, does a larger number of samples decrease the variance in our calculations?

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
ggplot(plots_2017, aes(x= sample_count, y = sd_tree_c_ha)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = plot_size_m2)) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm,
              color = "cyan4",
              se = F) +
  labs(title = "Tree Carbon variance per Sample plot",
       x = "Number of samples per Plot",
       y = "Variance of Carbon in each plot")
```

This graph shows that a larger number of samples decrease the variance in our calculations. But is there a way we can define our "sweet spot" of sample sizes? In the case of the 154m2 the 3,466 did lower the variance, but it sounds like a lot of work!.

Secondly, to correctly create a statistical approach, define an "ideal" sample count, and help guide sample sizes in future projects. We will use this data, and the pwr() package to estimate the number of samples needed to obtain a high power of confidentiality. In other words, depending on the means overlaps for each plot size, we will need more or less samples to get the 95% confidence that we are looking for.

First, we need to understand and visualize the overlaps that we currently have between our sample plots.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
#Total Tree Carbon (mg/ha)
histogram_all <- mangrove_2017 |> 
  filter(plot_size_m2 %in% c(25.133, 76.969, 153.938)) |> 
ggplot(aes(x=total_tree_mg_c_ha)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = stat(density), fill = plot_size_m2),color = "gray30", alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = plot_size_m2), col = "gray30", alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Carbon per Tree (Mg/ha)",
       subtitle = "2017")

ggplotly(histogram_all)
  
```

The histogram above shows the density between all tree measurements per plot size. The important part is to see the overlap between the sample types to calculate the power.

Another way to visualize this distribution of a single continuous variable of total tree carbon (Mg/ha) is by dividing the plot sizes into bins and using the frequency polygons `geom_freqpoly()`\` function to display the counts with lines. Frequency polygons are more suitable when you want to compare the distribution across the levels of a categorical variable.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
#Plotting just the lines
ggplot(mangrove_2017, aes(x=total_tree_mg_c_ha, color = plot_size_m2)) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(y = stat(density))) +
  labs(title = "Frequency Polygon",
    subtitle = "Invisible Histogram to see overlaps between Sample Size",
       x = "Total Carbon per Tree (mg/ha)",
       y = "Density")
```

Thanks to the Frequency polygon graph, we can see clearly the overlap between 77m2 and 154m2 plot types, which are way more correlated than the overlap with 25m2.

Thirdly, we will use the pwr.t.test function to estimate the number of counts we need from each sample plot to have a power of 90%.

```{r}
# Create the objects with the sd of each group
sd_25m = mangrove_plots_2017[[1,5]]
sd_77m = mangrove_plots_2017[[2,5]]
sd_154m =  mangrove_plots_2017[[3,5]]
mean_25m = mangrove_plots_2017[[1,4]]
mean_77m = mangrove_plots_2017[[2,4]]
mean_154m = mangrove_plots_2017[[3,4]]

```

#### A) Power between 25m2 and 154m2.

```{r}

mean_difference_a = mean_25m - mean_154m
d25_154 = as.numeric(sqrt(sd_25m^2/2 + sd_154m^2/2))

effect_size_a = mean_difference_a / d25_154

power_test_1 <- pwr.t.test(d = round(effect_size_a,2), 
                           power = 0.95, 
                           sig.level = 0.05,
                           type="two.sample",
                           alternative="two.sided")
print(power_test_1)
```

Because the means between 25m2 and 154m2 are so different, we will only need **twelve samples** to have a power of 95%.

#### B) Power between 77m2 and 154m2

```{r}
mean_difference_b = mean_77m - mean_154m
d77_154 = as.numeric(sqrt(sd_77m^2/2 + sd_154m^2/2))
effect_size_b = mean_difference_b / d77_154


power_test_2 <- pwr.t.test(d = round(effect_size_b,2), 
                           power = 0.95, 
                           sig.level = 0.05,
                           type="two.sample",
                           alternative="two.sided")
print(power_test_2)
plot(power_test_2)

```

In this case, as the means between 77m2 and 154m2 are closer together, we can estimate that with **Sixty samples**, we could have a power of 95%.

## **Conclusion**

Further research needs to be conducted with other mangrove reforestation sites to increase our confidentiality regarding the correct selection of plot sizes and tree measurements.

In order to increase our probabilities and reduce possible bias for future projects, its important to follow the VCS methodologies regarding uncertainty. A random stratified sampling could be a better approach than measuring every single tree in the reforestation. Nevertheless, this study supports the efforts put in place with the 77m2 and 154m2 sample plots as they show a general low variance in their calculations, and a significant lower amount of total measurement specially for the 77m2 plot, saving valuable time in the field. Assuming that all calculation are right in the initial provided data, this study successfully supports the initial question of what is an "ideal" number of samples to reduce extra effort, and still be certain of your estimates (see results of Question 3).  

Overall, Mangrove forests are an incredible biological ecosystem; this type of small analysis and efforts definitely help the nature-based solutions get closer to unimaginable changes in future projects. As this analysis has proved there are some questions being answered, but there are still some other important opportunities to be discovered regarding the structure of sampling according to the methodologies, which they seem to be the key factor for certain results.

PS. Thanks Silvestrum Climate Associates for sharing this collection of data samples data from one of your real reforestation sites.

#### Test the power results with random samples

Here, we have created a power table with the means and SD of your random table and run a power analysis with the selected random samples to test my results

Test your results 25m2 vs 154m2 by changing the number of samples!

```{r}

samples = 12
random_table_test <- mangrove_2017 |> 
  group_by(plot_size_m2) |> 
  slice_sample(n = samples)

power_table_test <- random_table_test |> 
  group_by(plot_size_m2) |> 
  summarise(tot_samples = n(),
            tot_plot_count = length(unique(plot)),
            mean_tree_c_ha_mg = mean(total_tree_mg_c_ha),
            sd_tree_c_ha_mg = sd(total_tree_mg_c_ha)) |> 
  mutate(plot_size_m2 = c("25m2", "77m2", "154m2"))

random_mean_25m = power_table_test[[1,4]]
random_mean_154m = power_table_test[[3,4]]
random_sd_25m = power_table_test[[1,5]]
random_sd_154m = power_table_test[[3,5]]

#Using all the samples
#Real Difference 
random_effect_size_a = (random_mean_25m - random_mean_154m) / (as.numeric(sqrt(random_sd_25m^2/2 + random_sd_154m^2/2)))

print(effect_size_a)
print(random_effect_size_a)

ggplot(random_table_test, aes(x= plot_size_m2, y = total_tree_mg_c_ha, col = plot_size_m2)) +

       subtitle = "Random sample size",
       x = "Plot Type",
       y = "Total Tree Carbon (mg/ha)",
       caption = paste("Difference between the real sample means is:",round(mean_difference_a,2),"(mg/ha)" ,"\nDifference between the randomly relected samples mean is:", round((random_mean_25m - random_mean_154m),2), "(mg/ha)"))
  
  
```

Test your results 77m2 vs 154m2 with 50 samples
