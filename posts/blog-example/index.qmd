Hi this my first class blog post, and this is my first graph in R.

SHARK

```{r echo = FALSE}

shark_x <- c(1,1,2,5,6,6.5,6.5,10,12,11,12,10,7,6,5,1)
shark_y <- c(0,1,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,1,-1,0,0,-2,0,0)

plot(shark_x,shark_y, type = "o", col= "blue")
```

This page is intended as a wake-up call, illustrating the progression before and after my master's degree. The graph you see here took a lot of time, lessons learned, and effort from my past self in August 2022. It was during this time that I started diving deeper into the field of data science.

This post is a way for me to express my creativity and share my belief that practicing, repeating, and staying disciplined can lead to incredible achievements. If you're reading this now, it's because you have a special dedication and commitment to paying attention. I want to sincerely congratulate you for genuinely engaging with my webpage. Your careful attention to detail is greatly appreciated.

The world needs more people like you who care about the environment. So, thank you.
