After graduating from Universidad Iberoamericana as a Mechanical and Electrical Engineer in Mexico City, I started my professional career as a Field Engineer at General Electric. I was the pioneer commissioner and field engineer for the smart lighting product development in the Latin America region. After 5 years, the GE Current smart controls and energy management software grew significantly and I ended up as the team leader for the global commissioning and tech-support team.

Then in 2021, I shifted my career to become the team headman and navigator of a racing sailboat to cross the Pacific. It was during this experience that I recognized the crucial role of data collection in driving effective restoration practices. This incredible ocean crossing not only transformed my life but also intensified my passion to pursue a Master's degree in Environmental Data Science at the renowned Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara.

As an individual, I embody energy and proactiveness, and now, as an Environmental Data Scientist, my vision is to empower cutting-edge technology companies by enhancing their data collection and analysis practices, enabling them to derive actionable insights and make a positive impact on the environment. Ultimately, my goal is to contribute to and empower solutions based on nature, such as carbon offset initiatives and the restoration and conservation of marine protected areas (MPAs). As Chief Seattle once said; "The Earth does not belong to us; we belong to the Earth. Let us cherish and nurture our home, for it is the only one we have."
