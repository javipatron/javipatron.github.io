    "text": "Introduction\nBlue carbon is attracting massive attention from governments, investors, and companies needing carbon accounting practices. Mangrove forests can sequester almost ten times more than boreal, temperate, or tropical forests, thanks to the mangrove biological characteristics. That is one of the main reasons they received the nickname of “The Superheroes of Climate Change.”\nCarbon stocks are the total amount of organic carbon stored within a system and are comprised of carbon pools, which fall into different bins: living aboveground living (live plants, including epiphytes); dead aboveground biomass (e.g., fallen branches); living belowground biomass (e.g., roots); and belowground carbon (sediment organic matter).\nWith that in mind, it is critical to understand the main factors to calculate the total mangrove carbon stocks’ in restoration practices. Additionally, to analyze and calculate an appropriate amount of tree samples and plot sizes to estimate the amount of carbon storage in the area.\n\n\n\nThe more you know: Mangroves (2020)\n\n\n\nIs there existing evidence for this question? If so, why is it inconclusive?\nBlue carbon accounting is a new strategy with few practical examples and evidence worldwide. Some methodologies align with the Verra non-profit organization VCS (Verified Carbon Standard) that helps us describe and outline the correct procedures to quantify the net greenhouse gas emission reductions and removals resulting from project activities implemented to restore tidal wetlands. For this case, the provided data uses equations and formulas designed on the VCS0032 and VCS0033 methodologies, which are aligned with the VCS."

    "text": "Data\nThe data are real field measurements from mangrove tree´s over 4 different replantation sites (2010, 2016, 2017, 2020). This data was provided directly to me by Silvestrum Climate Associates ®. This data is confidential and there is limited access to the site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations, spatial and temporal features.\nThe dataset has a measurement record for each tree´s height and canopy. With those measurements, Silvestrum has calculated the total tree carbon in (kg) and the total tree carbon per hectare in (Mg/ha). In this analysis, we will assume that the correct protocols and equations were followed for this purpose, and this analysis is dependent from those results.\nRegarding the dataset, the above and below ground carbon storage was assessed using a nested sub-sampling protocol along the 25m2, 77m2, and 154m2 transect following the Kauffman and Donato procedure. The equations for above and below ground biomass are defined by Comley and McGuiness.\nThe mathematically calculations made my the owner of this dataset is a limitation, as we do not have actual carbon samples to analyze. Another limitation is the possible man errors from the field sampling and the natural growth and variability from the mangroves.\nTo get you familiarized, the table below shows the first 5 rows of the data which this post will be studying.

Overall, the plot of 25m2 has a more considerable amount of carbon stock per hectare, however, with high variability, which is not very confident for the methodologies and the Verified Carbon Standard protocols.\nAn important take away to ask and further analyse with Silvestrum, is why the 25m2 samples are having the highest trees records and the highest tree density in comparison to the 77m2 and 154m2."

But is there a way we can define our “sweet spot” of sample sizes? In the case of the 154m2 the 3,466 did lower the variance, but it sounds like a lot of work!.\nSecondly, to correctly create a statistical approach, define an “ideal” sample count, and help guide sample sizes in future projects. We will use this data, and the pwr() package to estimate the number of samples needed to obtain a high power of confidentiality. In other words, depending on the means overlaps for each plot size, we will need more or less samples to get the 95% confidence that we are looking for.\nFirst, we need to understand and visualize the overlaps that we currently have between our sample plots.\n\n\nShow code\n#Total Tree Carbon (mg/ha)\nhistogram_all <- mangrove_2017 |> \n  filter(plot_size_m2 %in% c(25.133, 76.969, 153.938)) |> \nggplot(aes(x=total_tree_mg_c_ha)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = stat(density), fill = plot_size_m2),color = \"gray30\", alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_density(aes(fill = plot_size_m2), col = \"gray30\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Carbon per Tree (Mg/ha)\",\n       subtitle = \"2017\")\n\nggplotly(histogram_all)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram above shows the density between all tree measurements per plot size. The important part is to see the overlap between the sample types to calculate the power.\nAnother way to visualize this distribution of a single continuous variable of total tree carbon (Mg/ha) is by dividing the plot sizes into bins and using the frequency polygons geom_freqpoly()` function to display the counts with lines. Frequency polygons are more suitable when you want to compare the distribution across the levels of a categorical variable.\n\n\nShow code\n#Plotting just the lines\nggplot(mangrove_2017, aes(x=total_tree_mg_c_ha, color = plot_size_m2)) +\n  geom_freqpoly(aes(y = stat(density))) +\n  labs(title = \"Frequency Polygon\",\n    subtitle = \"Invisible Histogram to see overlaps between Sample Size\",\n       x = \"Total Carbon per Tree (Mg/ha)\",\n       y = \"Density\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to the Frequency polygon graph, we can see clearly the overlap between 77m2 and 154m2 plot types, which are way more correlated than the overlap with 25m2.\nThirdly, we will use the pwr.t.test function to estimate the number of counts we need from each sample plot to have a power of 90%.\n\n\nShow code\n# Create the objects with the sd of each group\nsd_25m = mangrove_plots_2017[[1,5]]\nsd_77m = mangrove_plots_2017[[2,5]]\nsd_154m =  mangrove_plots_2017[[3,5]]\nmean_25m = mangrove_plots_2017[[1,4]]\nmean_77m = mangrove_plots_2017[[2,4]]\nmean_154m = mangrove_plots_2017[[3,4]]\n\n\n\nA) Power between 25m2 and 154m2.\n\n\nShow code\nmean_difference_a = mean_25m - mean_154m\nd25_154 = as.numeric(sqrt(sd_25m^2/2 + sd_154m^2/2))\n\neffect_size_a = mean_difference_a / d25_154\n\npower_test_1 <- pwr.t.test(d = round(effect_size_a,2), \n                           power = 0.95, \n                           sig.level = 0.05,\n                           type=\"two.sample\",\n                           alternative=\"two.sided\")\nprint(power_test_1)\n\n\n\n     Two-sample t test power calculation \n\n              n = 11.46789\n              d = 1.58\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.95\n    alternative = two.sided\n\nNOTE: n is number in *each* group\n\n\nBecause the means between 25m2 and 154m2 are so different, we will only need twelve samples to have a power of 95%.\n\n\nB) Power between 77m2 and 154m2\n\n\nShow code\nmean_difference_b = mean_77m - mean_154m\nd77_154 = as.numeric(sqrt(sd_77m^2/2 + sd_154m^2/2))\neffect_size_b = mean_difference_b / d77_154\n\n\npower_test_2 <- pwr.t.test(d = round(effect_size_b,2), \n                           power = 0.95, \n                           sig.level = 0.05,\n                           type=\"two.sample\",\n                           alternative=\"two.sided\")\nprint(power_test_2)\n\n\n\n     Two-sample t test power calculation \n\n              n = 60.64108\n              d = 0.66\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.95\n    alternative = two.sided\n\nNOTE: n is number in *each* group\n\n\nShow code\nplot(power_test_2)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, as the means between 77m2 and 154m2 are closer together, we can estimate that with Sixty samples, we could have a power of 95%."

    "text": "Conclusion\nFurther research needs to be conducted with other mangrove reforestation sites to increase our confidentiality regarding the correct selection of plot sizes and tree measurements.\nIn order to increase our probabilities and reduce possible bias for future projects, its important to follow the VCS methodologies regarding uncertainty. A random stratified sampling could be a better approach than measuring every single tree in the reforestation. Nevertheless, this study supports the efforts put in place with the 77m2 and 154m2 sample plots as they show a general low variance in their calculations, and a significant lower amount of total measurement specially for the 77m2 plot, saving valuable time in the field. Assuming that all calculation are right in the initial provided data, this study successfully supports the initial question of what is an “ideal” number of samples to reduce extra effort, and still be certain of your estimates (see results of Question 3).  \nOverall, Mangrove forests are an incredible biological ecosystem; this type of small analysis and efforts definitely help the nature-based solutions get closer to unimaginable changes in future projects. As this analysis has proved there are some questions being answered, but there are still some other important opportunities to be discovered regarding the structure of sampling according to the methodologies, which they seem to be the key factor for certain results.\nPS. Thanks Silvestrum Climate Associates for sharing this collection of data samples data from one of your real reforestation sites."

    "text": "Then in 2021, I shifted my career to become the team headman and navigator of a racing sailboat to cross the Pacific. During this time, I volunteered in a coral restoration project in Fiji, where the collection of data was proven to be key for effective restoration practices. This ocean crossing adventure was a life-changing experience and fueled my enthusiasm to apply for the Masters of Environmental Data Science at the Bren School UCSB.\nI´m an energetic and proactive individual. My vision as an Environmental Data Scientist is to empower high-end technology companies by improving their monitoring practices on data collection and drawing actionable insights to foster a positive environmental impact. Ultimately, I aspire to work on natural climate solutions, carbon offset, and MPA restoration and conservation."
