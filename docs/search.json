    "text": "Then in 2021, I shifted my career to become the team headman and navigator of a racing sailboat to cross the Pacific. During this time, I volunteered in a coral restoration project in Fiji, where the collection of data was proven to be key for effective restoration practices. This ocean crossing adventure was a life-changing experience and fueled my enthusiasm to apply for the Masters of Environmental Data Science at the Bren School UCSB.\nI´m an energetic and proactive individual. My vision as an Environmental Data Scientist is to empower high-end technology companies by improving their monitoring practices on data collection and drawing actionable insights to foster a positive environmental impact. Ultimately, I aspire to work on natural climate solutions, carbon offset, and MPA restoration and conservation."
